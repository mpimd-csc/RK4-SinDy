# Discovery of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems using a Runge-Kutta Inspired Dictionary-based Sparse Regression Approach

This repository contains the Python implementation using the PyTorch framework to discover nonlinear dynamical system using a Runge-Kutta Inspired Distionary-based sparse regression approach. The methodology is depicted in the figure below.

The method combines machine learning (dictionary-based) with a numerical integration scheme, namely a Runge-Kutta scheme to discover governing equations using corrupted and sparsely-sampled data. The method does not require the computation of derivative information to discover governing equations. Hence, it holds a key advantage when data are corrupted and sparsely sampled. 

The important steps of the methodology are:

1. Collect measurement data  
2. With empricial knowledge, build a symbolic dictionary
3. Set-up an optimization problem by incorportating the fourth-order Runge-Kutta scheme
4. Solve the optimization problem using gradient-decent 
 	
we utilize automatic differentiation implemented in PyTorch. To promote sparity in the solution, we employ sequential thresholding, for instance proposed in [2]. 


## Contains
* `Dictionary`folder contains functions that build symbolic dictionary. 
* `Examples` folder contains all the examples considered in the paper. The results generated from these examples will be saved in the Result folder. 
* `Functions` contains externalized Python routines, e.g., solving sparsity-promiting optimization problem. 

## Dependencies
For reproducibility, we have stored all dependencies and their versions in `environment.yml`. An virtual enviornment, namely `RK4_SINDy` can be created using `conda` by using `conda env create -f environment.yml`.
